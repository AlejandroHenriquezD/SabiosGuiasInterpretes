## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The Editor used in this project
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
* [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - React-Leaflet uses ⚛️ React's lifecycle methods to call the relevant Leaflet handlers, which has a few consequences.
